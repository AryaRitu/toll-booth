Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge.
A car passing by the booth is expected to pay a toll.
The tollbooth keeps the track of the number car that gone and total cash amount collected.

Created a class tollbooth with the data member
-total number of cars passed
-total toll collected

necessary member function are:

1.A constructor that initializes both data member to zero.

2.paying car(): when any cars passes through the tollbooth , that much toll gets added into total toll collected and total number of cars passed is incremented by one.

3. nonpaying car(); increment the car total but adds nothing to cash total.

4.display(); the total number car passed and total cash collected.




Here is my prgm:



#include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>
class toolbath
{
int noc,tot;
public:tollbooth(int n=0,int t=0)
       {
       noc=n;
       tot=t;
       }
       void pay()
       {
       int i;
       noc++;
       cout<<"\n Enter the amount to pay toll:-";
       cin>>i;
       tot=tot+i;
       }
       void non_pay()
       {
       noc++;
       }
       void display()
       {
       cout<<"\n Total number of car passed:-"<<noc;
       cout<<"\n Total toll collected:-"<<tot;
       }
};
int main()
{
int n,t,ans;
char ch='y';
clrscr();
cout<<"\n Enter total number of car passed:-";
cin>>n;
cout<<"\n Enter total toll collected:-";
cin>>t;
tollbooth b(n,t);
while(ch=='y'||ch=='Y')
{
cout<<"\n Enter the car type:-";
cout<<"\n Press 1: for paying car";
cout<<"\n Press 2: for non-paying car";
cin>>ans;
if(ans==1)
b.pay();
if(ans==2)
b.non_pay();
cout<<"\n Do you want to continue(Y|N):-";
cin>>ch;
}
b.display();
getch();
return 0;
}
